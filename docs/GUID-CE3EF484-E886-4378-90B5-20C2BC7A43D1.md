# MACrt PLC & Go

MACrt PLC & Go is Microchip’s example to get started quickly with Power Line Communications \(PLC\). MACrt PLC & Go implements a basic application example of low data rate PLC \(up to 200 of kbps\) using OFDM modulation, that supports point to point and multi-point communications accessing through Microchip G3-PLC MAC realtime \(MACrt\) implementation \(G3\_MAC\_RT\).

G3\_MAC\_RT PLC includes some of the advanced features available in the G3-PLC MAC simplifying the communication process between devices:

-   TX/RX API Params Interface: configures/stores the transmission and reception parameters \(G3-PLC specific\)
-   TX/RX API Data Interface compatible with standard MAC 802.15.4
-   Automatic Medium access capabilities: CSMA/CA, retransmissions, inter-frame spacing
-   Automatic Link parameters selection between devices handled through TMR mechanism
-   ARQ Enabled/Disabled according to provided MAC 802.15.4 Data Header
-   Automatic segmentation and reassembly
-   Addressing according to provided MAC 802.15.4 Data Header: allows point to point \(unicast short/extended address\) or multipoint \(broadcast\) communication
-   Frame Reception filtering capabilities by own MAC address
-   Duplicated frames filtering
-   Sniffering capabilities

MACrt PLC & Go runs a chat application between two or more end points using Microchip PLC modem boards. The end points in this example are PCs which are connected via serial interface \(USB, UART\) to Microchip evaluation boards acting as PLC modems. Any end point can transmit a message, which is received by the destination \(one device or all\). The application example allows end points to configure several PLC parameters as PLC Band \(in case of using a Microchip evaluation board that supports several bands of transmission\).

Microchip PLC solution is flexible and provides designs optimized for several frequency sub-bands below 500 kHz. Adopters can decide which band to use based on application’s restrictions and /or communications performance, which can be affected by different types of noise sources in the PLC channel.
