# MPLABÂ® Harmony 3 Smart Energy G3 application examples

The following applications are provided to demonstrate the typical or interesting usage models of the PHY layer of the G3-PLC communication stack provided by Microchip.

|Name|Description|
|----|-----------|
|PHY PLC and Go|This example is intended to show a simple application running on top of the G3 PHY layer.|
|PHY Tester Tool|The PHY Tester tool is an application example that allows checking of the complete performance of the Microchip G3 PHY Layer on PLC boards|
|PHY Sniffer Tool|The PHY Sniffer is an application example that uses the PHY layer to monitor PLC frames in the G3 network and send them via USI serialization.|
|PHY Tx Test Console|The PHY Tx Test Console is an application example that demonstrates the complete performance of the Microchip G3 PHY Layer avoiding timing limitations in the PC host|
