  Summary:
    This file contains user instructions to edit Harmony 3 generated files

  Description:
    Some of the Harmony 3 generated files cannot be fully configured by the
    MPLAB Harmony Configurator (MHC).  This file contains instructions for
    the user to modify these files.

    The '#error' compiler directive is used to direct the user's attention
    to the instructions in the file.

    These edits should only need to be preformed once on the MHC generated
    code.
